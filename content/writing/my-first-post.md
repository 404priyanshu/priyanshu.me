# Hello World! 👋

This is my **first blog post** written in markdown. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences here.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a place to document my learning journey and share what I discover along the way.

### Topics I'll Cover

- Web Development with React and Next.js
- My coding projects
- Tips and tricks I learn
- Book recommendations

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Priyanshu"));
```

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more posts about my development journey!
